This project contains a shell for bootraping the access control assignment. Clone the repository on 
your local machines and configure it according to the steps outlines below


        a) Look at env-example located in resources and create a .env [naming is important,
           name it exactly as specified!] file that will be local to your environment
           
        b) Add the content from env-example but replace with the actual values for exaple where
           it says <your_database_name> replace it with the database name you will 
           create in your local database [User postgres]. Do the same for all the environmental variables.
